# Extract-AD-users-from-a-distribution-Group
Script which extract users belong to a distribution group in ActiveDirectory


I'm a fanboy Linux. I never code on windows. 

But I'm still "openminded" so I answer yes to a company for coding that. 
PowerShell is very easy and limited 

So what's do my program : 

It simply extract users from a distribution group, and in a time show the difference (compare) since the last extract. 

It's quite simple, your just need to set the var "$Currentdir" where is located the script.
